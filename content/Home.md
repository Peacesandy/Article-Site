## Variables
Just like other programming languages,JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as a container used to store content. Variables hold data and are used to store values example (name = 'John') or expressions (sum = x + y). In programming, a variable can simpy be explained as a name given to a value, so that you can access that value later. 

## Declare Variables in JavaScript

Before using a variable in a JavaScript Program, it need to be declared. They are three ways of declaring variables in Javascript, these are [Var] [let] and [const]. The var keyword is used to declare variables witha global scope, var is usually avoide because it can introduce bugs to a codebase.

## How to use var, let or const
1. Use `const` if the value should not be changed
2. Use `const` if the type should not be changed [Arrays and Objects]
3. `let` is usually used if you can't use `const`.

## Types of Variables in JavaScript
1. **Local Variables** : These are variables declared inside of a block or function

2. **Global Variables** : These are variables declared outside a function or with a window object. 

## JavaScript Operators

JavaScript expressions and operators are used to compare values, perform arithmetic operations, assign values, operations.
We have different types of JavaScript Operators.

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: They are used to compare the value, they are usually used to compute the value and to perform mathematical operations like addition and subtraction. Arithmetic operators include but is not limited to [+, -, *, /]

Example
```JavaScript
let x = 5
let y = 5

console.log[X+y]; //  10
```
