## RegEx (Regular Expressions)
Regular expressions are used to create patterns matching different parts of a string. Using a regular expression, you can define practices like; a letter preceded by a hyphen, a symbol followed by a number, or a bunch of different characters in a defined order. Regular expressions are supported in many other programming languages, and they have similar concepts. What this means is that a regular expression in one language will most likely achieve the same result in another language. However, there can be slight differences, which depend on the programming language or the Regex engine running the expression. Also, there can be multiple regular expressions for different patterns. Regular expressions can be used to define patterns.
