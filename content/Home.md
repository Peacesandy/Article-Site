## Variables
Just like other programming languages,JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as a container used to store content. Variables hold data and are used to store values example (name = 'John') or expressions (sum = x + y). In programming, a variable can simpy be explained as a name given to a value, so that you can access that value later. 

## Declare Variables in JavaScript

Before using a variable in a JavaScript Program, it need to be declared. They are three ways of declaring variables in Javascript, these are [Var] [let] and [const]. The var keyword is used to declare variables witha global scope, var is usually avoide because it can introduce bugs to a codebase.

## How to use var, let or const
1. Use `const` if the value should not be changed
2. Use `const` if the type should not be changed [Arrays and Objects]
3. `let` is usually used if you can't use `const`.
