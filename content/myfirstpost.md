JavaScript is the programming language of the web; it is undoubtedly the most popular language in the world. Brendan Eich developed JavaScript in 1995 to develop a programming language that would appeal to amateur programmers like Microsoft Visual Basic. Basically, JavaScript is used to add functionality to web pages, but over the years, JavaScript has evolved and is now widely used outside the browser. JavaScript enables developers to create interactivity and functionality for web applications.

Javascript has evolved over the years and has lots of frameworks available. Now JavaScript can be used for the backend using NodeJS.

## JavaScript: Definition
JavaScript is a high-level, dynamically typed language for creating dynamic web pages. JavaScript is lightweight and designed for creating functionalities like complex animations, API fetching, and collecting data. Today, JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used and can power web, desktop, and mobile applications. Learning JavaScript is now a prerequisite for people who want to be web developers.


## JavaScript Versions
ECMAScript is the official name of the JavaScript standard. You may often come across terms such as ES6, ES2015, ES2016, and so on, which refer to different versions or implementations of the standard. The latest approved version is ES2017. JavaScript is one of the most popular and widely used implementations of the ECMAScript standard.
